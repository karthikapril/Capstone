# _Project Title: Industrial Copper Modeling_ üìê
# _Skills: Python scripting, Data Preprocessing,EDA, Streamlit._

# _Problem: Problem Statement:_
## _The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing. However, this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, which can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. Dealing with these challenges manually can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions. A machine learning regression model can address these issues by utilizing advanced techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and leveraging algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data_

# _Step by Step approach_:
## _Data understanding, Data preprocessing, Exploratory data analysis, Feature engineering, Model building and evaluation AND streamlit GUI_
